                            <p>Many individuals struggle to maintain consistent exercise routines due to a lack of personalized guidance, motivation, and effective tracking tools. Existing fitness apps often fail to cater to specific health conditions and personal fitness levels, leading to user drop-off and ineffective fitness journeys. EXi aims to solve these issues by offering a customized exercise prescription based on individual health data and preferences, along with intuitive activity tracking features.</p>
